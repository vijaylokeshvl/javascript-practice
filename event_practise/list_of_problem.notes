🟢 LEVEL 1 — Core Muscle Memory (must be instant)

Do these without Google.

Create a button.
On click → change page background color.

Create an input box.

On keyup → show typed text in a <p> tag.

Create a div.

On mouseover → change its color.

On mouseout → revert back.

Create 3 buttons using same class.

Clicking any button logs its text.

Detect which key user pressed on keyboard and show:

You pressed: A


📌 If you can’t do this fast → revise basics.

🟡 LEVEL 2 — Real DOM Thinking (this separates learners)

Create a counter

+ button increases

- button decreases

Reset button sets to 0

Create a list (ul).

Input + Add button

On click → add new <li>

Click on a list item → delete only that item.

Create a form

Prevent page refresh

Validate:

name not empty

password ≥ 6 chars

Make a box follow mouse cursor (like a mini game character).

📌 This tests event + DOM + logic together.

🔴 LEVEL 3 — Interview / Pro Level (🔥 important)

Event Delegation

One click handler on ul

Clicking li removes it
👉 (No individual listeners on li)

Create modal popup

Open on button click

Close when clicking outside modal

Create like button

First click → ❤️

Second click → 🤍

(toggle using same button)

Stop event bubbling

Button inside div

Clicking button should NOT trigger div click

Throttle or debounce a scroll event (basic logic only).

📌 If you can do 11 & 14 confidently → you’re above average.

🧠 30-DAY REVISION TRIGGER (VERY IMPORTANT)

After 30 days, ask yourself these without coding:

Answer in words first.

Difference between:

onclick vs addEventListener

What is:

event object?

e.target vs e.currentTarget

What is:

event bubbling?

capturing?

Why event delegation is powerful?

When to use:

keydown

keyup

keypress ❌ (deprecated)

If you can explain, you’ll automatically code.

🚀 How I want you to practice (no BS advice)

Write HTML + JS on paper first

Then code

Then break it on purpose and fix it

No tutorials for these questions

If you want:

I can give solutions one by one

Or turn this into a 7-day DOM challenge

Or give mock interview DOM questions

Just say the word 👊

ok if i practise these 15q then then whenever i revise its benificial

Short answer: YES — 100% beneficial.
Real answer (no sugar-coating): if you do it the right way, this alone can carry your DOM confidence for months.

Let me explain why 👇

🧠 Why these 15 questions are actually enough

These 15 aren’t random. Together they cover:

✅ All core DOM events (click, key, mouse, submit)

✅ Event object mastery (e, target, currentTarget)

✅ State handling (counter, toggle, like button)

✅ Real-world patterns (forms, lists, modals)

✅ Interview favorites (bubbling, delegation, preventDefault)

If you can do these from scratch:
👉 90% DOM event problems become easy
