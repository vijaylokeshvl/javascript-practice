## Revision Strategy

For each question:
1. **Recall the core concept** - What type of event is being handled?
2. **Remember the DOM selection** - How do you select the target element(s)?
3. **Identify the event listener** - What event type and callback function are used?
4. **Understand the logic** - What happens when the event is triggered?
5. **Consider edge cases** - Are there any special conditions or error handling?

Use these questions to test your understanding of JavaScript event handling patterns and DOM manipulation techniques.
